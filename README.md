Algorithm Lab

Welcome to the **Algorithm Lab** repository! This project contains implementations of various algorithms, designed to serve as a resource for learning, reference, and collaboration. Whether you're a student, a developer, or just someone interested in algorithms, you'll find useful code and explanations here.

## Algorithms Included

### Search Algorithms
- **Linear Search**: A simple search algorithm that checks each element of a list until the desired element is found.
- **Binary Search**: An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items, reducing the time complexity to O(log n).

### Graph Algorithms
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures, starting from the root node and exploring all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures, starting at the root and exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together.
- **Quick Sort**: An efficient, in-place, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.

### Data Structures
- **Heap Algorithm**: Implementation of heap data structure and related operations.

### Dynamic Programming
- **Rod Cutting Algorithm**: An optimization problem that involves cutting a rod into smaller pieces to maximize profit.
